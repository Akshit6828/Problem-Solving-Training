## `Notes`

* If the student has a target to compete in the programming competitions like ***ICPC or Google CodeJam or Google KickStart or Meta Hackercup or TopCoder Open TCO***, so it's recommended to start with ***Codeforces sheets***, ***TopCoder sheets***, ***Spoj sheets***, ***UVa sheets***, and ***AtCoder sheets***, but if (s)he has a target to practice on ***a specific topic or preparing for an interview***, so it's recommended to start with ***HackerEarth sheets***, ***HackerRank sheets***, ***URI sheets***, and ***LeetCode sheets***.
* On each one of these sheets has an excel sheet to record your effort and enhance your progress, The time estimate for level problems is between ***30 min to 45 min*** for each problem, including ***reading time, thinking time, coding time, debugging time, and learning time***, and you can say that the sheet is done if you solved at least 30% of the sheet problems.
